<h1>FACTS ABOUT THE QUEEN</h1>
<p>
    The long reign of Queen Elizabeth II was marked by her strong sense of duty and her determination
    to dedicate her life to her throne and her people.
    She became for many the one constant point in a rapidly changing world as British influence
    declined, society changed beyond recognition and the role of the monarchy itself came into
    question.
    Her success in maintaining the monarchy through such turbulent times was even more remarkable
    given that, at the time of her birth, no one could have foreseen that the throne would be her
    destiny.

    While a lot is known about this long-standing monarch let&#39;s take a look at some maybe lesser-known
    facts about her.

<ol>
    <li>
        She celebrated two birthdays.

        <p>
            Queen Elizabeth II was born on April 21, 1926, but official celebrations don&#39;t take place until the
            second Saturday of June — a tradition that was started in 1748 by King George II.
        </p>
    </li>
    <li>
        She never went to school.

        <p>
            This might sound attractive to kids who&#39;d rather stay at home to play all day. However, she did have
            private tutors who taught her constitutional history, law, and French. Nevertheless, she often said
            she would have preferred having a formal education.
        </p>
    </li>

    <li>
        She was related to her late husband
        <img alt="" src="./static/img/3.jpg">
        <p>
            The late Prince Philip, Duke of Edinburgh, was a third cousin of Queen Elizabeth II, as both were the
            great-great-grandchildren of Queen Victoria. Elizabeth reportedly fell for the prince when she was
            just 13 and the two eventually married in November 1947.
        </p>
    </li>

    <li>
        She had her own fashion designer
        <img alt="" src="./static/img/4.jpg">
        <p>
            Norman Hartnell became the royal family&#39;s assigned designer after a series of commissions for the
            royal family. He famously crafted Princess Elizabeth&#39;s wedding gown and her outfit for the
            coronation.
        </p>
    </li>

    <li>
        She was not the richest person in Britain
        <img alt="" src="./static/img/5.jpg">
        <p>
            The queen&#39;s net worth, estimated by the «Sunday Times» at 370 million pounds, comes from her
            investments, jewels, and two castles. Instead, the richest person in the UK is the Duke of
            Westminster, whose net worth is 11 billion.
        </p>
    </li>

    <li>
        She also ruled the commonwealth
        <img alt="" src="./static/img/6.jpg">
        <p>
            She was not the ruler of just england, she was also the queen of other countries. These other
            countries are called the commonwealth which is formed by former british empire colonies. These
            include australia, india, pakistan etc... The commonwealth is however indipendent from england and
            there are no legal obligations for each state, instead being connected by their use of the english
            language and their shared history.
