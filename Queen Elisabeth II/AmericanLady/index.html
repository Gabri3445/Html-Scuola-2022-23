				<p>Noting that she exhibited no other signs of illness that would indicate a psychotic break, mental health experts told reporters they were baffled by local Iowa woman Terri Francis, who last week posted a thank-you message to Queen Elizabeth II on social media. «After studying Terri’s brain chemistry and her family’s medical history, we are no closer to understanding why she, an 56-year-old American woman, posted a heartfelt, emotional tribute to a recently deceased British monarch,» said psychologist Nancy Yates, who, in collaboration with dozens of top behavioral health experts across the country, proposed that perhaps early-onset dementia, schizophrenia, or a large brain tumor could be to blame for the mother of three posting a 600-word Facebook tribute that explored her love for a 96-year-old queen with whom she had absolutely zero connections. 
				Most Americans hate British people because the revolutionary war of independence happened which was caused by Americans themselves.
