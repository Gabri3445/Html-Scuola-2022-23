        <p>
            She was not the ruler of just england, she was also the queen of other countries. These other
            countries are called the commonwealth which is formed by former british empire colonies. These
            include australia, india, pakistan etc... The commonwealth is however indipendent from england and
            there are no legal obligations for each state, instead being connected by their use of the english
            language and their shared history.
